## What I had gain Design Thinking Project ‚ú®:
This design thinking project has been a personally enriching experience for me. Identifying the Biometric System Access Control issue allowed me to delve into the complexities of privacy, security, and ethics in technology. Working within a diverse team, I gained insights into effective collaboration, blending technical expertise, creative thinking, and a user-centric perspective. The empathy phase, mainly through user interviews, provided practical perspectives that influenced our design decisions. Engaging in ideation and brainstorming sessions fostered my ability to generate innovative ideas and consider multiple approaches to problem-solving. The iterative design process emphasized the importance of feedback and continuous improvement, shaping the evolution of our smartwatch prototype. This project not only deepened my understanding of technology challenges but also honed my skills in teamwork, user-centered design, and the iterative development process.

## Improvement üí™:
Although this design thinking project has been a worthwhile learning experience, a few critical areas may be improved. Firstly, including additional user feedback at every stage of the design process would improve the outcome. Although user interviews were carried out in the empathy phase, ongoing feedback sessions during ideation and prototyping would guarantee that the final product accurately reflects the preferences and requirements of the intended user base. Secondly, involving external experts or stakeholders in relevant sectors during the ideation process could foster a broader range of perspectives and potentially result in even more creative solutions. These upgrades are intended to fortify the user-centric methodology and augment the project's overall effect of design thinking.

## Others ‚ú®:
Reflecting on our design thinking exercise, I suggest a more structured approach to creativity, prioritizing individual idea generation. Additionally, incorporating an iterative testing procedure for user input at various stages could enhance the overall methodology by fostering diverse ideas and iteratively integrating user insights.
